# Groth16

After going through the [RareSkills ZK Book](https://github.com/zigtur/Rareskills-ZK-book),
I have decided to implement Groth16 in Python.
I know that there are existing implementation, on which I could inspire myself.

But, I have decided to take it my way.
The only thing that we need is Python3, some libraries and the most important: the [Groth16 paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf).

## Dependencies
```
pip3 install py_ecc numpy galois
```
